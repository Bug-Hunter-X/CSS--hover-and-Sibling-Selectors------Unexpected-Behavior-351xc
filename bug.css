The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `:hover` pseudo-class with sibling selectors.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.box {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 5px;
}

.box:hover + .box {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

The intended behavior is that when a `.box` element is hovered, its immediately following sibling `.box` element changes its background color. However, this only works when the hovered element is the first `.box`.  If you hover on a `.box` element that is not the first one, the effect won't cascade to the next sibling.  This is because the `+` sibling selector only targets the immediately following sibling, and not the next sibling of a hovered element which is not the first one. 

This subtle unexpected behavior can be a source of confusion and difficult to debug.
