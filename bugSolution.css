The issue can be resolved by using the general sibling combinator (~) instead of the adjacent sibling combinator (+).  The general sibling combinator selects all following siblings.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.box {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 5px;
}

.box:hover ~ .box {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

This corrected CSS ensures that when any `.box` element is hovered, all subsequent sibling `.box` elements change their background color to lightcoral.  Note that Javascript might be a more suitable solution if more complex logic is required to manage the hover effects.
